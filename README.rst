Serverlino - Basic Java Server for Static Http(s) websites
==========================================================

This is just a little practice project to stretch out some Java dev muscles, good unit testing practices, etc.

The server works (Currently serving, e.g. HarrisonTM.com), expect no guarantee of security or long-term stability however!
